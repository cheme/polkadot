//! Local scope for worker.
//!
//! Declaring a write local scope allows working on local change
//! without write conflict.
//! The absence of conflict is related to the fact that changes in
//! local scope never reach the parent worker and are dropped.
//! Changes can still be return as result, but this implies no
//! concurrent access.
//!
//! Read access in write local scope are still checked for concurrency
//! conflict (we do not run on a copy of the state).
